title: Calling the API

# Use API

You can manage most of Permit's functionality from the [web application](https://app.permit.io/).

That being said, you may want to use the API from time to time.

This can be achieved with Postman or any other REST client as well as with CLI tools like curl.

## Get your API Key

In order to call the API, you will need to get the API key from the Permit Dashboard.
Go to the [Settings -> API Keys](https://app.permit.io/settings/api-keys) screen.

:::note
If you are using the API to create new organizations, or manage higher-level actions that are not
environment specific, you will need to generate an organization key.

You can either reveal and copy an existing API key or create a new key by clicking on **Create Key**.

#### There are 3 types of API Keys:

1. **Organization API Keys** can act on your entire Permit Organization (i.e: workspace) and access all projects and environment within that workspace.
2. **Project API Keys** can access a single project and all the environments that belong to that project.
3. **Environment API Keys** can access a single environment. Only this type of API key can be used by the PDP container.

## Working with the API Logs

The whole of the permit no-code dashboard is API driven. This means that everything that you do in the UI,
can also be done via the API.

## API Docs

The API docs are available at [https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc](https://api.permit.io/v2/redoc)

## Using Postman

You can download [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/mac) and use it to experiment with the API.

You need to provide the API Key you got from permit in the Authorization header.

Select **bearer token** in the authentication type and paste your API Key there.

## Using CURL

You can use the [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/) command line tool to use or test the API.

You need to provide the API Key you got from permit in the Authorization header.

### Get all users

Run it with the following command to get all the users in your organization:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API Key>" https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{projectKey}/{environmentKey}/users
```

### Get all tenants

Use this command to get all your tenants:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API Key>" https://api.permit.io/v2/facts/{projectKey}/{environmentKey}/tenants
```
