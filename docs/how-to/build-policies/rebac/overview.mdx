# Relationship-Based Access Control

**Relation-based access control** is an authorization model that aim to give us the fine-grained access control for every single instance of data in our application.
By establishing the relationships between the resources and the users in our applications, we can define the exact permissions a user has on a single resource.

In the basics of ReBAC policy modeling, we are considering two types of relationships:
* **User-Resource Relationship**: This relationship is between the user and the resource.
By using this relationship, we can define the permissions a user has on a single resource.
In Permit, we are using resource-level roles to define this relationship, while the role policies are used to define the exact permissions.
* **Resource-Resource Relationship**: This relationship is between the resources themselves.
By using this policies, we can leverage the user to resource relationships to define role derivations that will implicity grant permissions to the user.

## Policy as Graph

Unlike RBAC and ABAC where configuring the policy is enough to enforce it, in ReBAC we also need to synchronize continously our application data to a graph that 
 the actual relationships between our instances in the system.
After we configured the schema of the relationships, we will sync our data to a stateful relationship graph.
When we will to enforce policies, the policy engine will query the graph to get the relationships between the user and the resource and return us the permissions the user has on the resource.

One of the powerful features of this graph query is the ability to give implict permissions to a user based on the relationships between resource instances.

:::tipLearn by Example
One of the simplest way to understand ReBAC, is learn from real world examples. Here are some examples of ReBAC in action:
- [Google Drive](/modeling/google-drive) - Your classic file sharing app - with file/folder hierarchy 
- [Galactic Healthcare](/modeling/rebac-GHC) - Healthcare app with user profile access delgation
- [Pink Mobile](/modeling/pink-mobile) - Teleco representive app - with account level access
