## The `permit.check()` Function

`permit.check()` is the main function used by Permit to enforce permissions in your application.
Depending on the complexity of the policy being enforced, `permit.check()` accepts several parameters to return a boolean answer - `Permitted=True` or `Permitted=Flase`.

There are many ways to use the function within Permit to enforce permissions. This can depend on the policy you are checking against, and the required level of granularity.

## Basic RBAC Check

The simplest enforcement point you can create using the `permit.check()` function is a Role-based Access Control (RBAC) policy.

To enforce RBAC, `permit.check()` requires three parameters to be passed:

- A unique `userId`
- An `action` this user will attempt to perform
- The `resource` for which we want to manage access to.

```js
const permitted = await permit.check("john@permit.io", "create", "document");

if (permitted) {
  console.log("John is PERMITTED to create a document");
} else {
  console.log("John is NOT PERMITTED to create a document");
}
```

## Tenants

[Tenants](https://docs.permit.io/overview/glossary#tenant) are silos or resources and users.
Tenants can be passed as part of the `resource` object inside the `permit.check()` function.

```js
const permitted = await permit.check("john@permit.io", "create", {
  type: "document",
  tenant: "companyA",
});
```

:::tip Simple example
Say you have two tenants - `Tenant A` and `Tenant B`. The same user can be part of both tenants, with a different role in each one.
I.e, The user can be `admin` in `Tenant A` and `editor` in `Tenant B`.

## Attributes

Sometimes, you might require more granular policies than simple RBAC. That's when Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) comes into play.
Specific user or resource attributes might be required to determine the conditions of when your authorization check should pass.

To do that, we need to pass an additional `attribute` parameter as part of the `user id` or `resource` by passing in a whole object

:::tip
You can learn more about passing data into Permit [here](https://docs.permit.io/how-to/manage-data/loading-data/)
:::

```js
const permitted = await permit.check(
  // the user object
  {
    // the user key
    key: "john@permit.io",
    // just-in-time attributes on the user
    attributes: {
      location: "England",
      department: "Engineering",
    },
  },
  // the action the user is trying to do
  "create",
  // Resource
  {
    // the type of the resource (the resource key)
    type: "document",
    // just-in-time attributes on the resource
    attributes: {
      hasApproval: "true",
    },
    // the tenant the resource belong to
    tenant: "companyB",
  }
);
```

## Relationships

In cases where you want to manage access based on the relationships between identities and resources. That's where Relationship Based Access Control (ReBAC) comes in.

The structure of relationships between identities and resources cab be defined via the **[UI](/how-to/build-policies/rebac/building-rebac-policies)** or **[API](/api/rebac/rebac-api-calls)**.

:::tip
In the code example below, we check if `John` has the `assign` permissions on a member group resource (Defined in Permit beforehand).
:::

```javascript
await permit.check(userId, "assign", `member_group:${group}`);
```
