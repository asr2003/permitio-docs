# Creating Policies with the Permit.io SDK in Python

This guide details how to use the Permit.io SDK to set up roles, resources, and permissions in a Python application.

## Overview

This script is designed to facilitate the creation and management of resources and roles with specific permissions in your Permit.io setup. It automates the process of checking for existing resources and roles and creates or updates them as needed.

## Prerequisites

- Python installed in your environment.
- `permit` package installed in your project.

## Script Breakdown

### Initializing the SDK

Initialize the Permit.io SDK with your projectâ€™s details:

```python
from permit import Permit

permit = Permit(
    pdp="https://cloudpdp.api.permit.io",  
    token="your_permit_key",
)
```

Defining Resources
Specify the resources you want to manage. Here's an example:

```python
resources = [
    {
        "key": "secret",
        "name": "secret",
        "actions": {
            "create": {},
            "read": {},
            "update": {},
            "delete": {},
        },
    }
]
```
### Defining Roles and Permissions
Define the roles and their associated permissions:

```python
roles = [
    {
        "name": "secret_manager",
        "permissions": [
            {
                "resource": "secret",
                "actions": ["create", "read", "update"]
            }
        ]
    }
]
```
### Creating Policies
The script iterates over the defined resources and roles, creating them using the Permit.io SDK:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    for resource in resources:
        # Creating each resource
        asyncio.run(permit.api.resources.create(resource))

    for role in roles:
        # Processing role permissions and creating each role
        role_permissions = [f"{permission['resource']}:{action}" for permission in role['permissions'] for action in permission['actions']]
        role_obj = {
            "name": role['name'],
            "key": role['name'],
            "permissions": role_permissions,
        }
        asyncio.run(permit.api.roles.create(role_obj))
```
### Running the Script
Execute the script in your Python environment.

The script automatically creates the defined resources and roles in your Permit.io dashboard.

### Notes
* Ensure that the pdp and token are correctly set for your Permit.io environment.
* The script avoids duplicating resources and roles by checking their existence before creation.
* Modify the resources and roles arrays to fit your specific requirements.

```python
import asyncio

from permit import Permit


# This line initializes the SDK and connects your python app

permit = Permit(
    pdp="https://cloudpdp.api.permit.io",  
    token="permit_key_",
)

roles = [
    {
        "name": "secret_manager",
        "permissions": [
            {
                "resource": "secret",
                "actions": [
                    "create","read","update"
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]

resources = [
    {
        "key": "secret",
        "name": "secret",
        "actions": {
            "create": {},
            "read": {},
            "update": {},
            "delete": {},
        },
    }
]

# create a script to create policy in permit this policy will be have a resource and a role with permissions
if __name__ == "__main__":
    for resource in resources:
        resource_obj = {
            "name": resource.get("name"),
            "key": resource.get("name"),
            "actions": resource.get("actions"),
            "description": "",
        }
        asyncio.run(permit.api.resources.create(resource))

    for role in roles:
        role_permissions = []
        for permission in role.get("permissions", []):
            role_permissions = role_permissions + [f"{permission.get('resource')}:{action}" for action in permission.get("actions")]
        role_obj = {
            "name": role.get("name"),
            "key": role.get("name"),
            "permissions": role_permissions,
        }
        print(role_obj)

        asyncio.run(permit.api.roles.create(role_obj))

```
