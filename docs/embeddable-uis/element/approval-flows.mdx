<br />

## Overview

Approval Flows offer a solution for managing ever-growing and frequent authorization requirements.
It is particularly valuable for development teams tasked with integrating secure access approval mechanisms in their applications,
accommodating both human users and AI agents.

### Key Features

Permit.io Approval Flows uniquely feature:

- **End-to-End Flow Management**: Provides both UI and code interfaces for complete control over the approval process.
- **Customizable Components**: Easily embeddable elements for UI applications, allowing for tailored user experiences.
- **Comprehensive Audit Logs**: Detailed records of flow configurations and authorization checks, ensuring transparency and accountability.
- **Wide Compatibility**: Works with any authentication and identity provider, offering flexibility in various environments.
- **Non-Native User Support**: Seamlessly integrates with principals, including AI agents, that are not traditional users.
- **Fine-Grained Authorization**: Facilitates precise control over permissions and access rights.
- **Managed Communication and Collaboration**: Streamlines the invitation and collaboration process, enhancing efficiency and user experience.

### AI agents
Today, most application users are humans - but this reality is bound to change drastically in the coming years, as other applications, such as AI and machine learning agents, will suppress human users. 
These agents tend to perform actions much faster, much more frequently, and on an unprecedented scale. It is also often hard to know exactly which data these agents will require access to. 
As completely blocking these agents defeats the purpose, we require a way to grant humans control over these agents in an organized way while maintaining the speed and scale they offer. 

Traditional models like Mandatory Access Control (MAC), where developers solely assigned permissions, have given way to Discretionary Access Control (DAC).
This shift is crucial in the era of AI and cloud-native architectures, where users often need to grant access to third-party AI applications
and define unknown data scopes.

The **Approval Flows Element and API** addresses these complexities by enabling a dynamic, policy-based approval process.
It allows developers to create flexible approval flows where permissions can be dynamically adjusted through policy changes,
catering to the complex nature of AI agent interactions. It empowers users to control access to their data by AI agents,
maintaining security and compliance.

### Early Access

Permit.io Approval Flows is currently in Early Access, and we will gradually open the feature to more users.
