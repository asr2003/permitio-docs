## Overview

Approval Flows offer a solution for managing ever growing and frequent authorization requirements.
It is particularly valuable for development teams tasked with integrating secure access approval mechanisms in their applications,
accommodating both human users and AI agents.

### AI agents

In the evolving realm of application development, the integration of AI agents presents new challenges in managing authorization.
Traditional models like Mandatory Access Control (MAC), where developers solely assigned permissions, have given way to Discretionary Access Control (DAC).
This shift is crucial in the era of AI and cloud-native architectures, where users often need to grant access to third-party AI applications
and define unknown data scopes.

The **Approval Flows Element** addresses these complexities by a enabling dynamic, policy-based approval processes.
It allows developers to create flexible approval flows where permissions can be dynamically adjusted through policy changes,
catering to the complex nature of AI agent interactions. It empowers users to control access to their data by AI agents,
maintaining security and compliance.

### Early access

Permit.io Approval Flows is currently in Early Access, and we will gradually open the feature to more and more users.
