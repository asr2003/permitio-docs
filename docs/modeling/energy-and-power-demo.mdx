title: Energy & Power Demo App
---

The Energy & Power Demo Application focuses on working with a big collection of data, and working with RBAC, ABAC and
resource instances to model this data within Permit. A big requirement within this app was to use Permit not only to create
and manage policies, but also to store significant data associated to each resource, that could then be utilized to further
evaluate more complex policies - creating a more restrictive access.
